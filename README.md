# FoodTracker
Small Calorie counter/Food tracking app for Android on Kotlin
Only done for myself, but feel free to use it yourself. Only maintained for myself, so no guarantees for anything.
I am professionally a Unity Game-Tech-Artist, not a Android-App-Frontend-Dev, and this is my first Kotlin project.
